# Biometric Authentication System

## Overview
This project is based on a biometric authentication system using a real-time face recognition access control system.

### Intuition
- This is our final year project, and this repository contains the source code and the published paper based on the project title.
- Real-time biometric authentication enhances security by utilizing fingerprint and facial recognition technologies, optimizing data processing for swift authentication and an improved user experience.
- We chose Python as the programming language and built the logic using algorithms such as CNN, Haar Cascade, LBPH, OpenCV, and Pandas.
- The frontend is a graphical user interface built using the Python library `tkinter`.

### Requirements
- Intel Core i5 or higher (Recommended)
- System with 4 GB or higher RAM
