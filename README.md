# Biometric Authentication System

## Overview
This project is based on a biometric authentication system using a real-time face recognition access control system.

### Intuition
- This is our final year project, and this repository contains the source code and the published paper based on the project title.
- Real-time biometric authentication enhances security by utilizing fingerprint and facial recognition technologies, optimizing data processing for swift authentication and an improved user experience.
- We chose Python as the programming language and built the logic using algorithms such as CNN, Haar Cascade, LBPH, OpenCV, and Pandas.
- The frontend is a graphical user interface built using the Python library `tkinter`.

### Requirements
- Intel Core i5 or higher (Recommended)
- System with 4 GB or higher RAM

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python Libraries**

   Open a terminal and install the following Python libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas seaborn numpy opencv_contrib_python imutils scikit-learn pillow
Set Up Anaconda Environment

Open Anaconda Prompt and run the following commands:


conda create -n tf python=3.8
When prompted for confirmation, type y and press Enter.
Activate the Environment

```sh
conda activate tf
Navigate to the Project Directory
